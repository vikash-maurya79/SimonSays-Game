# SimonSays-Game
Baer's job was to develop electronic toys and games. The best-known result of this partnership was Simon. Named for the children's game of "Simon Says," the game was inspired by an Atari arcade game called Follow-Me. Baer and Howard Morrison, a partner at Marvin Glass, first saw Follow-Me at a trade show in 1976
